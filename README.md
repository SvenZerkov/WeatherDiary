# Weather diary (project description) 
 

An open weather service is selected, from which the ready dataset is used.  

Let's create a server (divide what does what, MVC). The server has a part that transfers information from the weather application when the server starts. 

A separate interface for the web page that the user uses for making own notes. 

The user can add information about their "own" weather to a limited extent, the information of which goes to it's own database. 

Two databases, weather forecast and user updates from their own observations. 

EXTRAS: Filtering option on the web page, e.g. "on which day it snowed". 

The user has a (limited) opportunity to update information, add new comments and delete them.  

User cannot update the weather history –database only own commenst database.
