# Weather diary (project description) 
 

An open weather service is selected, from which the ready dataset is used.  

We create a server (divide what does what, MVC). The server has a part that transfers information from the weather application when the server starts. 

A separate interface for the web page that the user uses. 

The user can add their "own" notes about the weather to a limited extent (open comments). this information is saved to a different database, that we created. 

The weather info comes from open API and user updates from their own observations from our own database. 

Filtering option on the web page, e.g. "on which day it snowed".

The user has a (limited) opportunity to update information, add new comments and delete them.  

User cannot update the weather info from the open API.
