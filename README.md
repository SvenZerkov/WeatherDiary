Weather diary (project description) 
 

An open weather service is selected, from which the ready dataset is used.  

Let's create a server (divide what does what, MVC). The server has a part that transfers information from the weather application when the server starts. 

A separate interface for the web page that the user uses. 

The user can add information about their "own" weather to a limited extent, the information of which goes to it's own database. 

Two databases, weather forecast and user updates from their own observations. 

Filtering option on the web page, e.g. "on which day it snowed". 

The user has a (limited) opportunity to update information, add new comments and delete them.  

User cannot update the weather forecast â€“database.
